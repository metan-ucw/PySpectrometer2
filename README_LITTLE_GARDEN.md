How to use the software with little garden spectrometer
-------------------------------------------------------

* Start the spectrometer in native resolution:
  `PySpectrometer2-USB-v1.0.py --device 0 --width 1920 --height 1080`

* Press 'f' to flip the image

* Follow the callibration procedure from README.md

Note that a callibration is valid only for a given resolution, so if resolution
is changed the spectroscope has to be recallibrated.
